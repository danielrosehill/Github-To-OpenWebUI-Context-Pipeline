# Sample Document

This is a sample document to demonstrate the knowledge sync pipeline.

## How It Works

1. This file is located in the `sample-collection` directory
2. When synced, it will be added to the "Sample Collection" knowledge collection in OpenWebUI
3. The pipeline automatically converts the directory name to a prettified collection name

## Features

- Automatic sync when files are pushed to GitHub
- Support for various file types
- Incremental sync (only new or changed files are uploaded)
- Deletion tracking (files removed locally are also removed from the collection)

## Next Steps

Add more files to this directory or create new directories for additional collections.
